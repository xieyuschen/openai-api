# openai-api
A non-official Haskell library provides out-of-box methods to interact with openai.

This project is still under development so I did even not upload it on hackage. Due to the limitation of my knowledge of Haskell, there are still quite many problems inside the library including but not limited to:
- bed design
- duplicated code
- bugs...

If you get interested in this project, feel free to point out any problems you find, discuss with me about the design, or contribute to this project.
